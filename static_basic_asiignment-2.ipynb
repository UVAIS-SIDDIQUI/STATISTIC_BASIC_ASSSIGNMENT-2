    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables (whether they move in the same direction or opposite directions) and the strength of that relationship.\n",
    "Correlation is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It indicates both the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance can take on any value, positive, negative, or zero. However, its magnitude is not standardized, making it difficult to interpret the strength of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure and ranges between -1 and 1. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, 0 indicates no linear relationship, and -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Units:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is expressed in the units of the variables being measured.\n",
    "Correlation is unitless, as it is a standardized measure. It does not depend on the units of measurement of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance only indicates the direction of the relationship between variables (positive or negative) and the extent to which they change together, but it doesn't provide a standardized measure of the strength of the relationship.\n",
    "Correlation provides a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables. It is more interpretable and widely used compared to covariance."

    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can pull the mean in their direction, especially in large datasets, as the mean is sensitive to extreme values. This can result in an inaccurate representation of the typical value of the dataset.\n",
    "The median is less affected by outliers because it is not influenced by extreme values. However, if the dataset has a substantial number of outliers, the median might still be shifted slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can inflate the measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation, making them larger than they would be without the outliers.\n",
    "The range, for example, will increase if there are outliers that are much larger or smaller than the rest of the data.\n",
    "Variance and standard deviation, being based on the squared differences from the mean, will be significantly affected by outliers. Outliers with large deviations from the mean will increase the spread of the data and inflate these measures.\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate how outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset representing the salaries of employees in a company:\n",
    "\n",

    "{30000,32000,33000,35000,36000,37000,40000,45000,50000,200000}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, the majority of salaries fall within the range of $30,000 to $50,000, but there is one extreme outlier at $200,000.\n",

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we calculate the mean salary, the outlier at $200,000 will significantly inflate the mean, resulting in a misleading representation of the typical salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "\n",
    "The median, however, will be less affected by the outlier since it represents the middle value of the dataset. In this case, it would be closer to the typical salary range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: \n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of the outlier will increase the range of salaries from $20,000 to $180,000, even though most salaries are concentrated in a much narrower range.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: \n",
    "\n",
    "The outlier will cause a large deviation from the mean, resulting in higher variance and standard deviation, indicating a greater spread of salaries than is actually typical for the majority of employees."
